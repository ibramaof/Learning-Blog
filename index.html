                <p class="article-text">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've
                    made
                    the big jump over to
                    the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">My Journey Into Programming</h1>
            <p class="article-text">My journey into programming did not start with a clear roadmap. At the beginning, I
                was driven mainly by
                curiosity and the desire to understand how applications and websites actually work behind the scenes.

            <h1 class="heading">Discovering the Basics</h1>
            <p class="article-text">I began with HTML and CSS, learning how structure and styling come together to form
                a webpage. Simple layouts,
                spacing issues, and responsiveness were challenging at first, but seeing visual results kept me
                motivated.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Facing JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="article-text">JavaScript was a major turning point. Concepts like variables, conditions, loops,
                and functions felt abstract
                initially, especially when combined with DOM manipulation. I often struggled to understand why things
                didn’t
                work as expected.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Learning Through Projects</h1>
            <p class="article-text">Building small projects changed everything. Projects like a restaurant ordering app
                helped me understand state,
                events, and dynamic UI updates. Mistakes became lessons, and debugging became a daily habit rather than
                a fear.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Improving My Thinking</h1>
            <p class="article-text">Over time, I noticed my approach to problems improving. I started breaking problems
                into smaller parts, writing
                cleaner logic, and refactoring code instead of rewriting everything from scratch.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Where I Am Today</h1>
            <p class="article-text">Today, I don’t consider myself an expert, but I am confident in my learning
                process. I understand how to search,
                experiment, fail, and improve. Programming has become less about memorizing syntax and more about
                logical
                thinking and problem solving.</p>
