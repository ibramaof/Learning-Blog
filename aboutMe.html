                    <p class="aboutMe-p">After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've
                        made the big jump
                        over
                        to
                        the
                        Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <div class="post-cont">
                <p><strong>I stay committed to learning</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try
                    to
                    create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about
                    my
                    journey with the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>How I got started</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was
                    learning.
                    After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write
                    short
                    summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also
                    helping
                    others learn and stay motivated.

            <p class="article-text">My journey into programming did not start with a clear roadmap. At the
                beginning, I
                was driven mainly by
                curiosity and the desire to understand how applications and websites actually work behind the
                scenes.

            <h1 class="heading">Discovering the Basics</h1>
            <p class="article-text">I began with HTML and CSS, learning how structure and styling come together to
                form
                a webpage. Simple layouts,
                spacing issues, and responsiveness were challenging at first, but seeing visual results kept me
                motivated.</p>

            <h1 class="heading">Facing JavaScript</h1>
            <p class="article-text">JavaScript was a major turning point. Concepts like variables, conditions,
                loops,
                and functions felt abstract
                initially, especially when combined with DOM manipulation. I often struggled to understand why
                things
                didn’t
                work as expected.</p>
